                        Software documentation is like farofa in Brazilian cuisine: it is an essential ingredient, it can
                         be a bit dry, and it comes in many different forms. Finding the best parts (i.e., the bacon) 
                         can be difficult, and we need tools to uncover them. To help software developers uncover the best 
                         parts of software documentation, we are developing approaches to get information to them 
                         when and where they need it. This talk will highlight several approaches, including a task-based search 
                         interface for software documentation, an approach for improving compiler error messages with 
                         content from Stack Overflow, and a badge-generator for sections of GitHub README files. While much 
                         of the information needed by software developers is already available somewhere, we still have a 
                         long way to go to give developers the best tools for transforming documentation into bite-sized 
                         pieces.

                        Christoph Treude is an ARC DECRA Fellow and a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computer Science at the University of Adelaide, Australia. He completed his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Victoria, Canada, and spent two years in Brazil as a postdoctoral researcher at DIMAp/UFRN and IME/USP. The goal of his research is to advance collaborative software engineering through empirical studies and the innovation of processes and tools that explicitly take the wide variety of artefacts available in a software repository into account.

                <table>
                  <tbody>
                    <tr>

                        Software licenses govern the way software can be used and above all re-distributed, and range
                        across different levels of restriction, i.e., from very restrictive licenses such as Affero-GPL
                        towards permissive ones like Apache or BSD. The recent history of software projects is
                        permeated of cases in which a suitable (or unsuitable) decision about software licenses played
                        a major role in the success of a project.

                        Starting from recent literature and from problems actually encountered by developers, this talk
                        conjectures how legal and technical expertise need to be properly combined when developing and
                        evolving software projects. This has noticeable implications for practitioners, which require
                        to cope with factors they often neglect when choosing components, but also for educators,
                        responsible of introducing software licenses in computer science curricula, and, last but not
                        least, for researchers, which might make developers' life easier through the development of
                        licensing-aware recommender systems.
